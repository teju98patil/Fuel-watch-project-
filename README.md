## License and Academic Integrity Notice

I encouage usage and adaptations of this by anyone. I encourge students
of me to build a data science portfolio and this Homework Projekt can be
part of it.

The intention of this license is to

1.  ensure that students do not accidentially or purposeful hide away
    that a large part of the work is guided by the instructions. Even
    when the instructions are open, the work you did can show mastery of
    skills.
2.  help students to be transparent about what their own original work
    is.
3.  alert future students to not blindly copy from public work of others
    to ensure learning and avoid breaching academic integrity policies.

When you worked through this project, you can keep it in its finished
form as a public repository in your portfolio or publish the HTML from
the repository, when you keep the *License and Academic Integrity* part
in the README and the INSTRUCTIONS in the repository.
